Things That are incomplete:
* In main in the detection of flags from the cmd args there is no distinction
    as to weather a '-' is a flag or the start of a negative number

* There is no support for the insertion of the ans from a previous equation

* In main the main loop only runs once for testing and because the logic for
    resetting has yet to be implimented
